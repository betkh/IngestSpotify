## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

pipenv install
```

### 2. Get Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill in the app details:
   - App name: `Top Music Analytics`

## üéØ ID Collection - Collect list of IDs from SPARQL

Download the list of CSV files and use it to get further meta data about artists using the Spoitify API end points. Here's a SPARQL code that gets list of Spotify IDs for 1000 artists.

```SPARQL
SELECT ?artist ?artistLabel ?spotifyID WHERE {
  ?artist wdt:P31 wd:Q5;      # human
          wdt:P106 wd:Q639669;  # occupation: musician
          wdt:P1902 ?spotifyID. # has Spotify artist ID
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". }
}
LIMIT 1000

```
